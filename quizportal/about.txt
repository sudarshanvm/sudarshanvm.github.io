    The online quiz portal is a simple project for conducting the quizzes online. The project contains admin side and the user side. The admin can view and manage the users and also manage the quiz questions. The purpose of conducting the quizzes online is to save students’ time, as this online method needs less manpower to attempt the quizzes. The users are the students who take part in the quiz. A user has to login to enter the quiz. Once a user logs in, a list of courses will be displayed from which the user has to select the course for which he/she has to attempt the quiz.
